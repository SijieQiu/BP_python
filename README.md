# Beauty Premium
## 1.Introdiction

``The beauty premium is a well-documented phenomenon in the behavioral labor economics literature. It suggests that physical
attractiveness increases the probability that a person will engender positive attitudes and outcomes, which in turn are likely to lead to
tangible social and economic benefits.``

The dataset's researchers conducted a trust game experiment to investigate whether women are trusted more when they wear makeup than when they do not. Facial attractiveness, which was manipulated through the application of makeup by a professional makeup artist, was measured before and after makeovers. Trustors were shown a photograph of their female counterparts before they made decisions about money transfers to trustees. The results showed that wearing makeup increased perceived attractiveness, which in turn led trustors to make larger transfers to female trustees during the trust game. Additionally, the game discovered a pure makeup premium that was mediated by gender. Specifically, female trustees with makeup received larger transfers than female trustees without makeup when the trustors were men, even after controlling for female trusteesâ€™ levels of attractiveness.

## 2.Research Questions

Q1:What impact does wearing makeup have on the number of transfers? (by identifing the count of instances where the transfer value surpasses the average. Determine the distribution between makeup and non-makeup categories.)

Q2:How does an increase in perceived attractiveness (IncreaseAttract) influence the perceived 'Trustworthiness' of individuals in a given context?

Q3:Does the use of makeup (makeupdummy) significantly impact the perceived attractiveness increase (IncreaseAttract) in the trust game experiment?
